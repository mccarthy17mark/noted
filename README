This is code for learning & play. Uses c++ as language, SDML as library which puts stuff on your screen.

Acquire by using terminal to cd into a good directory (use ls to see what's where), then use the following command:
git clone https://github.com/markomemos/circles.git

Program currently compiled on mac using clang. Run program using ./build/apps/program

When developing, use "git status" a lot.
To make a branch, do "git checkout -b <new_branch_name>"
When done making a small number of changes do "git add -A" followed by "git commit" and filling in a commit message.
When done making a large number of changes (~1 per day) do "git push", just follow what it tells you about upstream origins because I never understand that.
When updating local repo from remote repo do "git pull"

Let Mark handle the pull requests and branch merging etc.

To edit code, use "emacs src/main.cxx &" or use whatever your favourite text editor is. You can use an IDE, but good luck getting it set up!

To compile, you will need to install SDML on mac (just google it and go to SDML webpage). You might also need clang (google it too).
Then use "make" and see if there are compile errors. Use "make clean" if you want to remove bad objects created by a previous make.
Don't touch makefile unless you know what you're doing!
